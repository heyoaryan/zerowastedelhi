# Location Detection & Nearby Bins Fix

## Issue Fixed
The BinTracker component was showing hardcoded static bin data instead of detecting the user's actual location and showing nearby bins. This has been fixed to:

1. **Get real user location** using browser's geolocation API
2. **Call backend API** to get location info and nearby bins
3. **Display correct nearby bins** based on actual detected location
4. **Show accurate distances** calculated from user's current position

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (`src/pages/BinTracker.tsx`)
- Added real geolocation detection using `navigator.geolocation`
- Integrated with backend API `/api/location/info` to get nearby bins
- Added loading states and error handling for location permissions
- Updated UI to show actual location information
- Added refresh functionality to reload location data
- Fixed data structure to match backend API response

### Backend Integration
- Connected to existing location service with comprehensive Delhi NCR coverage
- Uses proper distance calculation (Haversine formula)
- Returns bins within 1km (local) and 3km (nearby) radius
- Includes location validation for Delhi NCR area

## How to Run & Test

### Prerequisites
1. **MongoDB** - Make sure MongoDB is running on `mongodb://localhost:27017`
2. **Node.js** - Version 16 or higher

### Step 1: Setup Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm run seed  # This creates sample bin data across Delhi NCR
npm run dev   # Starts backend server on port 5000
```

### Step 2: Setup Frontend
```bash
# In root directory
npm install
npm run dev   # Starts frontend on port 5173
```

### Step 3: Test Location Detection
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:5173`
2. Login with test credentials:
   - Email: `rahul@example.com`
   - Password: `password123`
3. Navigate to "Bin Tracker" page
4. **Allow location access** when prompted by browser
5. The app will detect your location and show nearby bins

## Sample Data Coverage
The seeded database includes 30 smart bins across these Delhi NCR areas:
- Connaught Place, India Gate, Karol Bagh
- Lajpat Nagar, Chandni Chowk, Saket
- Khan Market, Nehru Place, Model Town
- Burari, Sant Nagar, Swaroop Nagar
- Ghaziabad, Narela, Rohini, Pitampura
- Dwarka, Laxmi Nagar, and more

## Location Detection Features

### Accurate Location Detection
- Uses browser's GPS for precise coordinates
- Validates location is within Delhi NCR bounds
- Finds nearest recognized area/landmark

### Smart Bin Filtering
- **Local bins**: Within 1km radius (priority)
- **Nearby bins**: Within 3km radius (backup)
- Real-time distance calculation
- Status-based filtering (active, full, maintenance)

### User Experience
- Clear location permission handling
- Loading states during location detection
- Error messages for location issues
- Refresh button to reload data
- Navigate button opens Google Maps directions

## Troubleshooting

### Location Permission Denied
If location access is denied:
1. Click the location icon in browser address bar
2. Change location permission to "Allow"
3. Refresh the page
4. Click "Refresh" button in the app

### No Bins Found
If no bins are shown:
1. Check if you're within Delhi NCR area
2. Try the "Refresh" button
3. Check browser console for API errors
4. Ensure backend server is running on port 5000

### API Connection Issues
If getting API errors:
1. Verify backend is running: `http://localhost:5000/api/health`
2. Check CORS settings in backend
3. Ensure `.env` file has correct API URL

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend (`.env`)
```
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Backend (`backend/.env`)
```
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/zero_waste_delhi_app
JWT_SECRET=your-super-secret-jwt-key-change-this-in-production
JWT_EXPIRE=7d
PORT=5000
NODE_ENV=development
```

## API Endpoints Used

### Location Info
```
GET /api/location/info?latitude={lat}&longitude={lng}
```
Returns user location info and nearby bins with distances.

### Response Structure
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "isInDelhi": true,
  "currentLocation": {
    "name": "Connaught Place",
    "area": "Central Delhi"
  },
  "allNearbyBins": [
    {
      "_id": "...",
      "binId": "BIN001",
      "location": {
        "area": "Connaught Place",
        "address": "...",
        "coordinates": { "latitude": 28.6315, "longitude": 77.2167 }
      },
      "status": "active",
      "capacity": { "total": 100, "current": 45 },
      "type": "recyclable",
      "distanceFromUser": 0.3
    }
  ],
  "message": "You are in Connaught Place, Central Delhi. Found 5 bins within 1km."
}
```

## Testing Different Locations

To test the location detection with different areas:
1. Use browser developer tools
2. Go to Settings > More tools > Sensors
3. Override geolocation with coordinates:
   - **Connaught Place**: 28.6315, 77.2167
   - **India Gate**: 28.6129, 77.2295
   - **Karol Bagh**: 28.6519, 77.1909
   - **Saket**: 28.5245, 77.2066

The app will show different nearby bins based on the selected location.

## Success Indicators
✅ Browser requests location permission  
✅ User location is detected and displayed  
✅ Nearby bins are loaded from backend API  
✅ Distances are calculated accurately  
✅ Bins are sorted by distance from user  
✅ Navigation opens Google Maps with directions  
✅ Refresh button reloads current location data  

The location detection now works correctly and shows the right nearby bins according to the user's actual detected location!
