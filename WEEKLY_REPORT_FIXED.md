# âœ… Weekly Report Fixed!

## Issue Resolved:
The "This Week" was showing 0 kg instead of the actual weekly contribution.

## ðŸ”§ What I Fixed:

### 1. **Weekly Calculation Logic:**
- **Before:** Divided monthly data by 4 (inaccurate)
- **After:** Calculates actual entries from last 7 days

### 2. **Real Weekly Stats:**
- **Weight:** Sums actual waste from last 7 days
- **Entries:** Counts submissions in last 7 days  
- **Points:** Totals points earned this week

### 3. **Enhanced Weekly Display:**
- **Stats Card:** Shows real weekly weight + entry count
- **Weekly Summary Section:** Detailed weekly impact
- **Progress Bar:** Visual goal progress (5kg weekly goal)

## ðŸ“Š Your Current Weekly Data:

### All Entries from Today (26/7/2025):
1. **Plastic waste:** 9.9kg - 50 points
2. **Plastic waste:** 10kg - 50 points  
3. **Plastic waste:** 10kg - 50 points

### Weekly Totals:
- **This Week:** 29.9 kg âœ…
- **Entries:** 3 submissions âœ…
- **Points:** 150 points âœ…
- **Goal Progress:** 100% (29.9kg / 5kg goal) âœ…

## ðŸŽ¯ Dashboard Now Shows:

### Stats Cards:
- **Total Waste:** 29.9 kg
- **This Week:** 29.9 kg (fixed!)
- **Reward Points:** 150
- **Weekly Goal:** 100%

### Weekly Summary Section:
- **ðŸ“… This Week's Impact**
- **29.9 kg** Waste Collected
- **3** Entries This Week  
- **150** Points Earned
- **Progress bar** showing 100% of weekly goal

## ðŸ”„ How Weekly Calculation Works:

### Logic:
```javascript
// Gets entries from last 7 days
const oneWeekAgo = new Date();
oneWeekAgo.setDate(oneWeekAgo.getDate() - 7);

const weeklyEntries = entries.filter(entry => {
  const entryDate = new Date(entry.createdAt);
  return entryDate >= oneWeekAgo;
});

// Calculates real weekly totals
const weeklyWeight = weeklyEntries.reduce((total, entry) => total + entry.weight, 0);
```

### Features:
- âœ… **Real-time calculation** from actual entries
- âœ… **7-day rolling window** (not calendar week)
- âœ… **Accurate totals** based on submission dates
- âœ… **Dynamic updates** as new entries are added

## ðŸŽ‰ Result:

**Your dashboard now shows accurate weekly data instead of 0!**

- **This Week:** 29.9 kg (all your entries are from today)
- **Weekly Goal:** Exceeded (29.9kg vs 5kg goal)
- **Progress:** 100% complete
- **Entries:** 3 submissions this week

The weekly report is now fully functional and shows real data based on your actual waste submissions!
