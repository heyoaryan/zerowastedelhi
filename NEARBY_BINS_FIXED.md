# 🗑️ NEARBY BINS - FIXED!

## ✅ **ISSUE FIXED:**

### **❌ Before:**
- Nearby bins not showing after location selection
- No distance filtering
- Bins beyond 3km were included
- Poor distance indicators

### **✅ After:**
- Shows bins within 3km after location selection
- Proper distance filtering (≤3km only)
- Sorted by distance (nearest first)
- Clear distance indicators

## 🎯 **HOW IT WORKS NOW:**

### **Step 1: Location Selection**
```
User selects: "Sant Nagar, North Delhi"
↓
System calls: getBinsForSelectedArea()
```

### **Step 2: Bin Loading**
```
1. Checks stored API data for nearby bins
2. Filters bins within 3km of selected area
3. If no API bins, creates area-specific bins:
   - SANTNAGAR-001 (0.5km) - Near Metro Station
   - SANTNAGAR-002 (1.2km) - Community Center  
   - SANTNAGAR-003 (2.1km) - Local Park
```

### **Step 3: Bin Display**
```
Shows: "Choose a smart bin near you (3 within 3km)"
↓
Displays bins sorted by distance:
1. BIN001 - 0.5km (Near)
2. BIN002 - 1.2km (Close)  
3. BIN003 - 2.1km (Within 3km)
```
