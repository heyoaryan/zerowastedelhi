# Signup Issue Fixed ✅

## Problem Identified
Users couldn't sign up because the password validation was strict but the requirements weren't clearly communicated.

## Password Requirements
Your system requires passwords to have:
- ✅ **Minimum 6 characters**
- ✅ **At least one uppercase letter** (A-Z)
- ✅ **At least one lowercase letter** (a-z)
- ✅ **At least one number** (0-9)

## Examples of Valid Passwords:
- ✅ `Password123`
- ✅ `MyPass1`
- ✅ `SecurePass2024`
- ✅ `ZeroWaste1`

## Examples of Invalid Passwords:
- ❌ `password123` (no uppercase)
- ❌ `PASSWORD123` (no lowercase)
- ❌ `Password` (no number)
- ❌ `Pass1` (too short)

## What I Fixed:

### 1. Frontend Improvements
- ✅ Added password requirements display on signup page
- ✅ Better error messages showing specific validation failures
- ✅ Clear visual indicators for password requirements

### 2. Testing Results
```
✅ Signup with 'Password123': SUCCESS
✅ Login with created account: SUCCESS
✅ Duplicate email rejection: SUCCESS
✅ Invalid password rejection: SUCCESS
```

## Test Account Created
